# Diplomats in Germany

The German ministry of foreign affairs (AuswÃ¤rtiges Amt) regularly updates a list of all foreign diplomatic missions and their diplomats, which are accredited by the Federal Republic of Germany.

The list in PDF format could be retrieved from the following [website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/diplomatische-vertretungen-in-deutschland/199678?openAccordionId=item-199682-0-panel). Click on *"Diplomatische und andere Vertretungen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland"* to retrieve the newest version of the PDF file.

## Problem
It is difficult to study changes in the list over time, mainly because of two reasons:
- Previous versions of the list are not made available, even if you have saved the specific link to the respective PDF file. therefore the files needed to be downloaded regularly.
- Even, if you have downloaded multiple versions, it is hard to compare the data in the PDF format itself and therefore needs to be extracted for easier comparison.  
[Have a look at the PDF](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/199684/c35dae946fa87b4e98973889e1aaf791/vertretungenfremderstaatendl-data.pdf) for a better understanding.

## Motivation
This project could help overcome the mentioned problems, by checking regularly if a new version of the list was published. If a new version was found, the data is being extracted from the PDF file and saved in a database. To track changes between the versions, a raw data vault DWH model is used.

This data model could help answering questions such as:
- How many diplomats were accredited in Germany at a given time?
- What is the average time diplomats spent at the various diplomatic missions in Germany?
- What is the gender ratio for a specific diplomatic mission?

## Infrastructure

The following tools and technologies were used:

- Cloud - [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com)
- Infrastructure as Code software - [**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io)
- Containerization - [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com), [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Batch Processing - [**Python**](https://www.python.org)
- Orchestration - [**Airflow**](https://airflow.apache.org)
- Transformation - [**dbt**](https://www.getdbt.com)
- Data Lake - [**Google Cloud Storage**](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- Data Warehouse - [**BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)
- Data Visualization - [**Data Studio**](https://datastudio.google.com/overview)

## Run the Walkthrough Tutorial

**Pre-Requisite:** Create a free [GCP account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) if you do not have one. Note that GCP also offers [$300 free credits for 90 days](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier/#free-trial).

You can follow this interactive instructions as a guide through the setup process.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/LoHertel/diplomats-in-germany&cloudshell_tutorial=project-walkthrough.md)

After clicking the button *Open in Google Cloud Shell*, the Google Cloud Shell Editor will open and ask for your authorization to clone this repository. 
The interactive walkthrough for the project will be displayed on the right side of the Cloud Shell Editor.  
*Note: There might be an error message showing up, that third party cookies are needed. You can allow third party cookies for the Cloud Shell Editor. For [more information see here](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/shell/limitations#private_browsing_and_disabled_third-party_cookies).*

> ***Note:** If you have closed the walkthrough and want to reopen it, run the following command in the cloudshell terminal window:*
> ```sh
> cd ~/cloudshell_open/diplomats-in-germany && cloudshell launch-tutorial project-walkthrough.md
> ```

If you don't want to use Cloud Shell Editor you could go through the instructions manually: [Open Instructions](project-walkthrough.md)

## Further Improvement
* Setup
    * create shell script for VM setup and integrate it in Terraform (also make [SSH key creation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/create-ssh-keys#create_an_ssh_key_pair) more robust or use Google service account auth method to connect to VM)
    * create project specific IAM role for Terraform and assign it to the service account instead of granting the permissions directly
    * limit permissions to the minimal necessary set
    * Create an additional service account for running the data pipeline (currently the Terraform user with a lot of permissions is used)
    * integrate cloudbuild for CI / CD
    * add tests for CI
* Airflow
    * create DAG for initial load
    * find out why XCOM doesn't work with task groups in Airflow
    * use Cloud Composer instead of Compute Engine VM
* dbt
    * add business data vault 
* Data Studio
    * remove calculated fields from Data Studio report and precalculate this data in the datamart (otherwise we can not use the report as template and change the data sources)
    * compare differences between two report dates
* spell checking
