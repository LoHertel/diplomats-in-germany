> **Small update**: The infrastructure image was wrong and I had to redact text in the markdown docs. And there was an error in the terraform `main.tf` file. No other changes were made. You can check the [last commit](https://github.com/LoHertel/diplomats-in-germany/commits/main).

# Diplomats in Germany

The German ministry of foreign affairs (AuswÃ¤rtiges Amt) regularly updates a list of all foreign diplomatic missions and their diplomats, which are accredited by the Federal Republic of Germany.

The list in PDF format could be retrieved from the following [website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/diplomatische-vertretungen-in-deutschland/199678?openAccordionId=item-199682-0-panel). Click on *"Diplomatische und andere Vertretungen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland"* to retrieve the newest version of the PDF file.

## Problem
It is difficult to study changes in the list over time, mainly because of two reasons:
- Previous versions of the list are not made available, even if you have saved the specific link to the respective PDF file. therefore the files needed to be downloaded regularly.
- Even, if you have downloaded multiple versions, it is hard to compare the data in the PDF format itself and therefore needs to be extracted for easier comparison.  
[Have a look at the PDF](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/199684/c35dae946fa87b4e98973889e1aaf791/vertretungenfremderstaatendl-data.pdf) for a better understanding.

## Motivation
This project could help overcome the mentioned problems, by checking regularly if a new version of the list was published. If a new version was found, the data is being extracted from the PDF file and saved in a database. To track changes between the versions, a raw data vault DWH model is used.

This data model could help answering questions such as:
- How many diplomats were accredited in Germany at a given time?
- What is the average time diplomats spent at the various diplomatic missions in Germany?
- What is the gender ratio for a specific diplomatic mission?

## Infrastructure

The following tools and technologies were used:

- Cloud - [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com)
- Infrastructure as Code software - [**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io)
- Containerization - [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com), [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Batch Processing - [**Python**](https://www.python.org)
- Orchestration - [**Airflow**](https://airflow.apache.org)
- Transformation - [**dbt**](https://www.getdbt.com)
- Data Lake - [**Google Cloud Storage**](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- Data Warehouse - [**BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)
- Data Visualization - [**Data Studio**](https://datastudio.google.com/overview)

## Run the Walkthrough Tutorial

I have created interactive instructions to guide you through the setup process.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/LoHertel/diplomats-in-germany&cloudshell_tutorial=project-walkthrough.md)

By clicking the button, the Google Cloud Shell Editor will open and ask for your authorization to clone this repository.  
The interactive walkthrough for the project will be displayed on the right side of the Cloud Shell Editor.
